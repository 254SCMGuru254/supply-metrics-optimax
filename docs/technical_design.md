## Implementation Details

### Core Optimization Models

#### Facility Location Optimizer

The facility location optimizer implements state-of-the-art mathematical optimization techniques:

- **Multi-Period Optimization**: Based on Melo et al. (2009), this model considers time-varying demand, capacity expansions, and operational changes over multiple periods.
- **Green Facility Location**: Incorporates carbon emissions and environmental constraints in the facility location decision process.
- **Objective Function**: Minimizes the total cost including fixed facility costs, transportation costs, and expansion costs while meeting demand constraints.
- **Mathematical Formulation**:
  ```
  min ∑_f,t (FC_f * y_ft + EC_f * z_ft + ∑_d d_fd * x_fdt)
  s.t. ∑_f x_fdt ≥ D_dt ∀ d,t
       ∑_d x_fdt ≤ C_f * y_ft + ∑_τ≤t z_fτ ∀ f,t
       y_ft, z_ft ∈ {0,1}, x_fdt ≥ 0
  ```
  where:
  - y_ft: Binary variable indicating if facility f is open in period t
  - z_ft: Capacity expansion variable for facility f in period t
  - x_fdt: Flow from facility f to demand point d in period t
  - FC_f: Fixed cost of facility f
  - EC_f: Expansion cost for facility f
  - d_fd: Distance from facility f to demand point d
  - D_dt: Demand at point d in period t
  - C_f: Capacity of facility f

#### Routing Optimizer

The routing optimizer implements advanced transportation optimization:

- **Real-Time Routing**: Based on Toth & Vigo (2014), considers dynamic travel times with traffic variations.
- **Multi-Modal Integration**: Optimizes across different transportation modes (road, rail, air, sea).
- **Time Window Constraints**: Respects delivery time windows and operational constraints.
- **Mathematical Formulation**:
  ```
  min ∑_r t_r * x_r
  s.t. ∑_r t_r * x_r ≤ T_max
       x_r ∈ {0,1}
  ```
  where:
  - x_r: Binary variable indicating if route r is used
  - t_r: Dynamic travel time for route r
  - T_max: Maximum allowable time window

#### Inventory Optimizer

The inventory optimizer implements hierarchical inventory optimization:

- **Multi-Echelon Optimization**: Based on Graves & Willems (2008), optimizes inventory across multiple levels of the supply chain.
- **Risk Pooling**: Accounts for demand aggregation and variance reduction in higher echelons.
- **Service Level Constraints**: Ensures target service levels are met while minimizing costs.
- **Mathematical Formulation**:
  ```
  min ∑_f (h_f * SS_f + b_f * (1-SL_f))
  s.t. SL_f ≥ SL_target
       SS_f ≥ z(SL_f) * σ_f * √(L_f + R_f)
       SL_f ∈ [0,1], SS_f ≥ 0
  ```
  where:
  - SS_f: Safety stock at facility f
  - SL_f: Service level at facility f
  - h_f: Holding cost at facility f
  - b_f: Stockout cost at facility f
  - z(SL_f): Service level factor (inverse normal CDF)
  - σ_f: Demand standard deviation at facility f
  - L_f: Lead time at facility f
  - R_f: Review period at facility f
